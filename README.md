Database used is PostGresql and the database name is 'happiness'
It contains 6 tables users, student, alumni, discussion, favourites and answer

Node is used at backend and Angular at frontend.

In this project there are basically two type of users -
  1. Student
  2. Alumni

Both of them can view each others profile. The basic idea is that they can find
which person can be helpful to them and they can contact them in there free hours.

There is also a discussion forum where user can post questions and answers questions
to help others out.

Database used is PostGresql and the database name is 'happiness'
It contains 6 tables users, student, alumni, discussion, favourites and answer

Node is used at backend and Angular at frontend.

In this project there are basically two type of users -
  1. Student

which person can be helpful to them and they can contact them in there free hours.

There is also a discussion forum where user can post questions and answers questions
to help others out.
